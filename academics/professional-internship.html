        Professional internship is an important component in the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) Programme at SUNA Institute of Science &amp; Technology.
      </p>

     <p>
       The internship is meant to provide practical experience to the students on the operational setup and tasks in IT departments and how they affect the progress of every institution in its day-to-day operation. It is hoped that the field experience will urge our students to apply their best skills in enhancing the performance of every sector by means of information, communication and technology.
     </p>

     <p>
       During of the internship period, our students are prepared to give their best to the institution and they are subjects to the professional rules and procedure of the management.
      In addition, one possible field observation on the students by a supervisor from us, student evaluation forms are sent for filling by your institution.
