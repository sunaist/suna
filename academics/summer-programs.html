      <p>
        Upon completion of every semester and course programme, SUNA is compelled to divert attention of students into another beautiful but meaningful idea. This gave birth to the annual summer programme on ICT and Professional Studies in 2015.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first edition graduated 20 students, while the second edition awarded certificates to 60 students. Most of the participants were students in different tertiary education institutions such as the university of the Gambia and the Gambia College and from various high schools in the Gambia.

      <h2>Children in ICT</h2>

      <p>
        As part of our commitment to social development, SIST has initiated its ‘Summer Code for Young Programmers’ Project, which aims to build computer coding and programming skills of emergent developers from disadvantaged communities. Kids less than 12 years old formed the cornerstone of our interventions in this regard.
      </p>

      <p>
        They studied selected areas from the basic education module of SUNA ICT Department for two month period.
