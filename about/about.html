      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Suna Institute of Science and Technology (SIST) was conceived by Mr. Alhagie Jallow in September, 2013 while he was a final year BSc student majoring Information Systems in the School of Information Technology and Communications at The University of The Gambia.
      </p>


      <p>
        Alhagie has long dreamed of being able to create positive changes and enhanced happy livelihoods for almost every person he meets and interacts with.  He is a young, creative, innovative and results-oriented person who recognized what the potentials of technology and a digital economy could offer towards the advancement of humanity in general, but especially in The Gambia. As a native Gambian, he believes charity begins at home. He began to learn about the most pressing social and technological needs of the Gambian populace. Eventually he became motivated to establish an institute that specializes in both ICT trainings and development of ICT products and consultancy services in order to address prevailing IT problems and challenges in The Gambia.  By founding SIST, he fulfilled his desire to effectively begin contributing towards national development and for enhanced living for all Gambians.
