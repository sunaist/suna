        Our students are at the core of everything we do and we know that student life is an integral part of their development. We are committed to ensuring that we nurture, develop, challenge and motivate all of our students to be the best that they can be. We have student alumni association that create platform for students to socialize, discuss and work collaboratively on life changing skills and community based projects such as debate, drama, radio programs, mentorship programs, etc.

        There is no limit to the personal achievement that our students can’t reach. We are constantly challenging them to reach and exceed their aspirations professionally, socially, physically and through their creativity. The Institute also has its own ways of celebrating our students’ excellence during our graduation celebration week in a form of organizing pool party in one of the reputable hotels in the Gambia.
