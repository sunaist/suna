Late 2013, I have found my way to suna institute of science and technology then called Suna Consultant. i was at grade 10 of senior secondary school. At suna, I realized that they were offering various professional courses ranging from ICT courses to Private Wassce Remedial classes. I was interested in the private wassce remedial claases because I wanted to finish senior secondary. Fortunately, I was the first student to enroll at Suna. During that period, I was the only one in the remedial classes for about three weeks then I was joined by other students. I was taught by Mr Ebrima Bah (English), Mr Abdoulie Bah (Mathematics), Mr Ansumana Sanyang (Science), Buba Tamba (Physics) and Pa Omar Konteh (Chemistry).  These were people who are best at what their subject areas. I am so grateful to them all.

In late 2014, I decided to focus on ICT with the advice I got from the CEO and other staff of Suna. I registered and start my IT course when I was going to grade 11. My first ICT lecturer was Mr Amadou Barrow, who is very talented in ICT. I learned a lot from him during the course. Within those durations, I have make an in depth research on ICT and its benefits to the society, which I found to be amazing. From that moment on, I decided that I will choose ICT as my career path. The CEO, Alhagie Jallow, was my mentor and was guiding and coaching me in the ICT.  He provided me with all the supports I needed to progress. I used to give me ICT materials and always took to ICT presentation anywhere he is invited too. I also received support from people like Abdul Ala Camara, Abdourahman Baldeh, Kawsu Jabbi, Bakary Njie, Fabakary Minteh and others who were lecturing at the institute.

In 2015, I decided to register for Private Wassce Examination because
I wanted to finished senior school early. I seek advice from the CEO of Suna and he encourages me a lot to study hard if I want to pass the examination successfully. I adhere to his advice and sat to the exam and I successfully pass it with flying colors whiles I was still in grade 11.
</p>

<p>
After I took my result, he told me to apply to the University of The Gambia to further my career in ICT. I applied and I was accepted at the university whiles in grade 11-12. From that moment, I started teaching ICT as a teaching assistant at Suna were I assist the lecturer in the course. During that period I learned a lot about teaching methodologies. My passion for ICT began boost because I was engaging and teaching students on IT.
</p>

<p>
At Suna, I have worked with a lot of people who were very passionate about that they do. I work under the management of Mr Ebrima Bah, were I was a supporting staff to the admin. Under his management, we need focus on team work to bring success to the institution. I am honored to work under his management and I learned under him in administration.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am a staff at suna and I also teach summer ICT courses to people under 18. I am also a student of University of The Gambia studying information systems and also serving in the student union council as the assistant minister of information and communication.
</p>

<p>
I would like to thank the management of Suna for giving me the chance to realize my talent in ICT and I would also like to appreciate the efforts of my coworkers people like Bully Bojang, Alhagie Camara, Ebrima Jaw, Ebrima York, Fatoumatta Sankary, Christin Manneh, Fatou Bintou.
