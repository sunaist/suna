This is the story of a young man who was never optimistic that he will be successful in life.
</p>

<p>
It all started here: my name is Muhammed Baldeh, a 20-year-old Gambian-born child and belong to the Fulani tribe. During my final year of studies at secondary school, I aimed to study political science at the University of the Gambian (UTG) upon completion. After graduating in 2015, I don’t meet the requirement of the University while the college enrollment has also passed.

I was not pursuing any meaningful venture for my life. I was basically just roaming around town and hanging out with friends while I consider myself a failure at that particular stage of my life. Until one Friday when I was listening to the radio and heard the advert of Suna: that there is an institution in Brikama that is located opposite the police station, and they offer different IT programs. It was my first day to hear the name Suna.
The following morning, I decided to pay a visit to the Institute in order to be briefed on the available programs offered. I was pretty much happy with the reception of the staff during my visit to the Institute. I requested for the list of programs she gives me a booklet shut off where I read all the programs that they are offering, and it sounds interesting to me. I was thoroughly introduced to the programs by Ms Ramatoulie, former admin secretary and I finally choose the ICT 101 – Information Literacy and became enrolled as expected.

<p>
Two weeks later, I was called for an orientation where I meet the cross section of the staff of Suna including the CEO. During that orientation session, the CEO buttressed on the history of Suna, followed by the introduction of staff as well as the course lecturer Mr Kawsu Jabbie. We were issued our course schedule which was Monday 9:00 – 11:00 am and Wednesday 15:00 – 17:00 GMT. The course duration was 4weeks.
In summary, lectures began smoothly and the course content was clearly very thorough and comprehensive. It was something very interesting to me and has shifted my focus from political science to computer science. Interestingly for me, I became so passionate about the word ‘technology” which becomes the rhythm of my heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
Well, I should have just stopped at the first level but due to some motivation that makes me continue to the next level. The three main motivational factor for my persistence includes flexible lecture schedules, competence team of lecturers and conducive learning environment including state of the art facilities. These have enabled me to proceed up to Diploma level in IT. At Suna, when students completed their diploma course on IT, they are sent for a four weeks internship program as part of the requirement for the diploma program. I emerged as one of the best candidates in my graduating class of 2016 for the diploma cohort.
</p>

<p>
I was opportune to be called by the management to serve as an intern in the Institute with the goal of contributing my quarter towards the quality of services provided by the Institute. Therefore, I would like to thank the entire administration of the Institute for giving me the chance to sharpen my skills on daily basis.
