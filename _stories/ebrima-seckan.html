My name is Ebrima Seckan, A 25 year old Gambian living in Kombo Darsilami. I attend my Primary school in St Patrick’s Lower Basic School in the same place from 1999 to 2005 before I moved to the Upper Basic School until 2008.
</p>

<p>
I spent the period 2010 to 2013 in the senior secondary school. Following my West African Senior Secondary School Certificate (WASSCE), I took a three year break amidst uncertainties of what the next step should be.

<p>
One day, a friend introduced me to the science of internet browsing. As if it was a click on the keyboard, my interest for Information Technology grew and rose up to a high degree. I created a social media account through which I got contact with one Carol Ann who asked me about myself.  After explaining to her about status, she encouraged me to go for an IT course.
</p>

<p>
After several research on which school is the most suitable for my studies, SUNA INSTITUITE OF SCIENCE AND TECKNOLOGY became the most recommended centre. This was the beginning of my career and life at SUNA IST.
</p>

<h3>MY LIFE HISTORY IN SUNA</h3>

<p>
  Upon arrival on the first day at SUNA, I wasn’t informed about the kinds of courses to study or the duration of studies. The rest of the information I was to know was contained in a barouche I was given at no fee.
</p>

<p>
As my urges for a closer relationship with the computer continue to grow, I book a meeting appointment with the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the institute for career counseling.
</p>

<p>
   Mr. Alhagie Jallow welcomed ushered me into a greater personal confidence. Two weeks after feeling and submitting the admission form, I received a call notifying me of the orientation to the certificate programme. From the meeting, I had a fair knowledge on the administrative structure of the institute, the academic calendar showing both curricular and non curricular activities at my finger tip.
</p>

<p>
  The classroom became the hub of my connection with genuine friend, friend of the same fathers with me. It is a place to compete and support one another. The sense of school life which has gone out of my own system return in me to the best state. I found the both the administration and lecturers very friendly and open to students.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike in the past, I was able to maintain competitive attitude throughout the course and the school admin didn’t hesitate to award distinctive recognition to me upon my graduation.
</p>

<p>
  This good starting was enough for me to hit into the diploma class with full force. At this time the school environment had prepared to decide on courses of my preference which is highly required of a student in higher level. The jigsaw puzzle I attempted to fix at the end of every lecture was the possibility to implement the knowledge I gained in real-life situation.
</p>

<p>
  However, before I could get into the job market proper I felt oblige to maintain my close association with the institute to be able to test my unlocked skills in the field of technology.
</p>

<p>
  As a volunteer, I serve in the unit responsible to process online registration of students into all tertiary institutions operating in the Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system such as the Gambia College. This business enables me to explore SUNA IST service packages for other institutions in addition to the connection it provide me with a large number of students on daily base.
