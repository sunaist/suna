<p>
  I am Christine, a young Gambian lady from Lamin Daranka, Kombo North District of the West Coast Region. I completed my senior secondary education in 2014 at Methodist Academy, Brikama.
</p>

<p>
  After my completion, I was basically not engaged in any further education or skill acquisition until such time that my Father through a radio adverts, called and informed me about the operation of a new Information Technology (IT) training institution at Brikama called Suna Institute of Science &amp; Technology which is located just opposite Brikama police station. I knew my Father wanted the best for me and I had to make a decision if am interested in enrolling in their programs with a goal of acquiring the much-needed skills in IT. Then I finally made the decision of visiting the institute to make some enquiries regarding the enrolment procedures.

<p>
  With passion and drive for excellence, I came down to the institute’s admin building and met the admin secretary who briefed me on the enrollment protocols. Interestingly, I was able to get the application form for just fifty dalasis (D50) and provided all the required credentials to complete my application pack for the program.  A few days later, I was called by the secretary for our orientation and I was opportune to meet new friends in both my program and those in the other programs within the Department of Information Communication Technology.
</p>

<p>
Few minutes into the orientation program, we were introduced to the lecturers, staff and management of the institute including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Alhajie Jallow. They’ve delved more on the importance of technology in our modern societies and how the potentials in IT can help in revolutionising the future of Africa. Towards the end of the session, we were told to negotiate a convenient lecture scheduled across the week amongst ourselves that will be suitable for all the freshmen in our cohort.
</p>

<p>
The following week, we started our course on ICT 101- Computer Literacy. We were introduced to the fundamentals of IT including the different parts of the computer and their functions, typing, how to create an email, etc. I was like “waaw!”, although it was kind of challenging at the beginning, but with the help of my erudite lecturer, Mr Amadou Barrow, who subjected us to varieties of lab sessions, independent project works, demonstration and simulation sessions, we were able to overcome them and I finally came out with flying colors at the end of the course.
</p>

<p>
The first foundation course has ignited our taste to know more about IT, which enabled us to get enrolled in the Microsoft Office Application (MOA) specialisation programs that range from the foundation, intermediate to advance level. These courses has equipped us with all the applications in MS Office pack (Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, etc.) as well as business &amp; professional writing, online file management and independent projects such as designing interactive student management registers, database management, dashboard designing for multiple data visualization, monitoring and management, etc. Each of the levels or programs differ from each other in scope, intensity and student independent works/projects.
</p>

<p>
As per program requirement for the Advance Microsoft Office Application program, a month internship within the industry was incorporated which gives me the opportunity to work at St. Peter’s Technical Junior and Senior Secondary School at Lamin as IT Tutor. The internship has allowed me to hone my skills, especially those in my field of study, practice public speaking, presentation skills and perform actual teaching and mentoring with experienced, brilliant, and like-minded people. The internship has also given me the courage to start something from scratch and, with hard work and diligence, see it through to the finished product. Throughout the internship program at St Peter’s, majority of the students were so much inspired and even pledged to study IT upon completion of their secondary education. An awesome but decorated farewell program was staged for us, the interns, as their own ways of appreciating our immense contribution in shaping their vision and focus for life after completion of secondary education. The day was punctuated by series of fun, speeches and taking photos of remembrance and social networking.
</p>

<p>
After successful completion of the programs, we’ve written our internship reports and went into the final examination which turns out to be impressive. One of the most intriguing moment for me was when we were to present our internship experience to our team of instructors, junior instructors, senior and junior administrators as well as the various cohort of students within the Department of Information Communication Technology. To my surprise, I was remarked as one of the outstanding presenters of the day and was able to fascinatingly tackled emerging questions as they were directed to me while on the podium. It was that very moment that I unquestionably embraced the institute household slogan that Suna absolutely cherish her students’ excellence.
</p>

<p>
As the end result of the persistent hard work, determination, perseverance and diligence, the entire efforts were crowned with a golden-silver like graduation gown with a silver-like hood, in a procession to receive my certificate with merit equivalence on the 15th October 2015. It was, in fact, more gratifying to be among the very first cohort of graduates with Advance MOA certificate for our very own Suna Institute of Science &amp; Technology.
</p>

<p>
Just a little fast forward, I was given the opportunity to work as Intern at the Consultancy and Technical Unit of Suna IST for a duration of two months. After which, our performance and competencies were reviewed and were successful in securing an extension of an internship for another 2 months at the Institute as the Secretary/ Admin Assistant to the Office of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am specialising in database management and graphic designing. In the future, I plan to do more specialisation programs in database management and graphic designing and to see where curiosity in IT takes me.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I would like to proudly and confidently thank our very own CEO, Mr Alhajie Jallow and the entire staff, management and lecturers of Suna Institute of Science and Technology for all the support, mentorship and for creating the enabling environs for me throughout my stay here at Suna. To my parents, I would like to recognise and celebrate your unconditional love and support for me throughout my life.
</p>

<p>
Glory be to Suna for bridging the gap and setting the stage for the new breeds of IT professionals in The Gambia.
