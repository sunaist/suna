To start with my name, I am Alagie, a Gambian by nationality and hailed from a village called Kulary, Tumana District in the Upper River Region of the Gambia. I attended Brikama Upper Basic School and later proceeded to Maahad Senior Secondary School where I completed in 2014.
</p>

<p>
When I graduated from Senior Secondary School in 2015, I was practically not involved in any meaningful ventures that could earned or enabled me to get answers to my insatiable quest for best in life. I went through series of trials to travel to Europe which includes some visa applications and was not materialised. I am with a strong conviction that no one would like to know or feel how frustrated and seemingly traumatised I was in those moments of my life.

<p>
With Allah’s special blessings of being surrounded and appreciated by great friends, I was able to revamped and refocused my dream from travelling to Europe into building my capacity through education (IT in this case). Fortunately for me, the friend himself was one the scholarship recipient of Suna IST’s best students’ awards from various Senior Secondary Schools in West Coast Region. He was able to explore on some of the remarkable landmark success stories the institute has registered over the few duration of time ranging from accreditation of their programs, quality of lecturers, extra-modern facilities as well as open-door policies for students – tutor mentorship program. Without wasting any more time, I literally visited the institute and follow the enrollment processes and that marked the beginning of my story with Suna and how it redefined my life at a time when I needed change the most.
</p>

<p>
A couple of days after the submission of my application for the Foundation course, I received a telephone call from the Admin Secretary informing me about my orientation date with emphasis that I should attend. Being the person that I have always been (with smiles), I put together my best outfit as am ready to be part of the little few young people that are enthused with zeal, courage, and determination to set the pace for others to follow. On that orientation ground, I was really very much inspired and motivated by the great speeches delivered by the honourable staff of the Institute. Shortly after the orientation program, we’ve freely and openly negotiated on our course schedule as agreed by all.
</p>

<p>
Few days into the program, I noticed a sudden shift from my view and perception that “With or without Europe, I can still make it here!” That was the emergence of “The New Me” and I was able to maintain that status-quo with renewed vigour and commitment to scale up to higher heights. That was how the use of computers became a significant factor in my life on daily basis.
</p>

<p>
In overall, I was able to successfully complete the first course called MOA 101 Foundation of Microsoft Office Application and subsequently proceeded to MOA 102 – Intermediate Microsoft Office Application which has further widened my understanding and deepens my taste for higher or advanced programs in order to ensure independence, mastery, and competencies in the subject area. These two courses have improved my knowledge and have even helped in securing some real life little projects and started earning some money through small contracts from some friends on ITC. This is what makes me to fully believe that I can make it here as well.
</p>

<p>
I later proceeded to enrol in the Diploma in IT Program in the same Institute. It was the highiest program run by the Institute at that time and it was designed to bridge the gap between professionals and application of IT in solving problems or issues in the industry/community. It was absolutely a very challenging endeavor for us but with the professional guidance and mentorship from our very able lecturer Mr Amadou Barrow, it all became a smooth ride for all of us.
</p>

<p>
However, at the end of the Diploma course, we were sent to various departments for a 4 weeks internship program in order to apply the concepts and principles learned from the program into the real life work experience. To that effect, I was attached to the IT Department of the Gambia College with a friend and a course mate called Amadou Touray for a duration of 4 weeks. Our two giant supervisors were Mr Alhagie Jallow and Mr Gerrit Marskamp, a Network Expert from Holland. He taught on different concepts on networking including network manipulation especially WAN.
</p>

<p>
After serving the Gambia College for 4 weeks, we went back to class and had our final exams on the diploma course. A day after the exams, we had our presentations on the internship experience. In attendance were the team of assessors including Mr Jallow, the CEO of Suna IST, course coordinator, and our able lecturers. Administrative staffs were also in attendance during the deliberations. Questions were thrown at us from all sides of the audiences pertaining to our internship experiences which could be described “very interactive”. It was indeed an interesting journey as we learned a lot throughout the process.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after completion of my diploma program, I pioneer a small IT business outlet which focuses on designing and printing of certificates, business cards, logos, banners and was later expanded it to internet café. I must at this juncture recognised the help of my dear friend (Gilliam) in constantly helping to start this business in harness. The inspiration and motivation that was injected into me during my studies at Suna, has indeed connected me to my dreams. At a very personal level, operating my own business is the best thing that ever happens to me.
</p>

<p>
In the same vein, I am currently on a part-time job at the Consultancy Department of the Suna Institute of Science &amp; Technology. I worked in the said Department of the Institute for the past 6 months and now I want to further my programs to enhance my skills which even motivated me to sign up for Database Management System. I wish to proceed even further with the training in IT to higher height in a systematic fashion.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I must re-echo that the Institute has offered me the space to grow as an individual, to try new things and to meet new and interesting people. It's a place where you're never far from a new opportunity or experience - some of these I grabbed with two hands. A very big thank you to the staff and management of Suna IST for celebrating my excellence and redefining my life.
