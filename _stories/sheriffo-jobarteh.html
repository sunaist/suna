<h2>GREAT TIMES IN SUNA</h2>

<p>
My name is Sheriffo Jobarteh, aged 21. I recently completed my diploma in information communication technology (ICT) at Suna Institute of Science and Technology where I am currently on internship at the said Institute. I had great and educative moments at Suna, which would be valuable to for my entire life. Some of these fascinating moments are highlighted below.

<h2>CERTIFICATE LEVEL:  FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>
This is where everything started, I began to know how to switch on/off the computer, how to open a folder, use of various applications in Microsoft Office package including words, excel, powerpoint, access, etc. I was thoroughly introduced to each of those applications in the MS Office package as well as principles and fundamental of Information Technology. I can imagine how interesting for me to learn how to control the mouse, sit in an upright position when using the computer for a long time without developing any form of postural defects or problems etc. All these were taught by my able teacher Mr Sambou at the certificate level. It was from that moment that I was able to create my own email account, Facebook and other social media platforms.

<h2>DIPLOMA LEVEL</h2>

<p>
My diploma level was a continuation of the certificate level and it was during this course that I had an extensive knowledge and skills on the use of Microsoft Office applications and other related concepts such as professional business writing and hands-on projects. At this level, I learnt how to create or design good certificates, birthday cards, business cards using Publisher. Even though it was a huge challenge for me to understand the intricacies of Access database, with concentration and focus on the course which makes me understand and get familiar with it application environment. I was also able to enhance my typing skills to be faster than ever before. My lead lecturer for this program was My York who has really demonstrated his exceptional and scholarly understanding of the platform. At some point, I was even shown on how to set printers and execute printing of different page setups. I found these experiences very exciting and fulfilling.

<h2>PREPARATORY PRIVATE WASSCE CLASSES:</h2>

<p>
In another perspective, Suna Institute of Science and Technology does not only stop at providing IT training for young people in the society but they also go further to help exams focus preparatory classes for those who need to sharpen their credit quality in their subject areas of interest for West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE).  I was able to register with them for the Mathematic group and has absolutely prepared me enough to secure a good credit score in the coming WASSCE private sittings. Their classes are extremely very flexible and can suit different people including the working classes too.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I would like to thank the management of Suna Institute of Science and Technology for their endless effort in moulding me a very productive and competent young IT professionals which will indeed increase my proficiency and efficiency. I would like to encourage every youngster or anyone who thinks that they canâ€™t succeed in life, I can assure them that with the right resources, mentorship, motivation and encouragement you will receive from the great team of Suna, you will certainly debunk your initial stance about been successful in life is indeed a clear possibility.  Finally, I strongly believe that your success in life surely depends on your determination and hard work.
