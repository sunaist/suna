         <p>
           During his most recent tenure in the IT industry, Mr. Barrow has fed his insatiable interest in application of IT in Business and emerging software applications in healthcare delivery systems through his undergraduate and postgraduate projects at the University of The Gambia and the University of Benin respectively. His interest in the IT, however, is rooted in humanitarian concerns, as reflected by the current low utilization of IT in Business and other sectors such as healthcare services as significant predictors to low output and productivity.
