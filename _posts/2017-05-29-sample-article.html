The 2017 kids Programme for Children were designed to introduce Kids between the age group of 5 to 15 years old to a software called Scratch and its usage. During the course of the program, Kids will study selected areas from the basic education module of SUNA ICT Department for six weeks period.

Scratch is an online program that targeted kids as young as 5 years of age and it’s primarily enhanced and invoked their creative, artistic and analytical minds and abilities while availing them the opportunity to collaborate and share with other online users.

This training package has numerous benefits to the kids especially in the aspect of developing their computational thinking, learning and approaches to problem-solving and iterative design abilities. Coding is an empowering skill on its own and very fun for the kids to tag along with while learning. By extension, kids can be able to relate with Apps created by other kids and be in a position to modify or customize them to fit their preferences. Empowering kids with computer skills at a tender age gives them an upper hand in class work as they are able to grasp concepts easily as their orientation and problem-solving skills has been enhanced and deepened.

Interestingly, Scratch program helps kids to be equipped with digital fluency skills which enable them to design, create and mix digital content and not just to browse, chat and interact with the platform. Varieties of projects can be created using scratch like stories, animations, games and even interaction with the physical world.

<h1>Expected outcomes</h1>
<p>
	By the end of the program, participants should be able to demonstrate understanding in the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enhanced abilities to write stories using the scratch.</li>
	<li>Improved abilities to create games and animations using the scratch.</li>
	<li>Enhanced their problem solving, designing and creative abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The programme is specifically meant to prepare Kids to be able to develop computational thinking approaches and ignite their logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. We believe this will smoothen the career path and positively transformed their reasoning abilities as they grow and follow their various career path.
