SUNA Institute of Science & Technology Diploma students will also take part in hands  in internship work experience program for approximately a one-month period.  They will work in community business organizations to gain actual experience in applying the Microsoft applications they have learned in the classroom.  Our comprehensive internship programme is designed to introduce them to real life work situations and how they can contribute as a productive employee in a business office or any working environment using the education and skills they have mastered in their diploma classes. The students are also supposed to use their knowledge in information technology to teach those that have no knowledge in this area, and to learn how to socialize with clients in terms of office work.

In January 2016, twenty-seven students were placed for internship in very recognized organizations like NARRI, GRA, AREA COUNCIL, and GAMBIA COLLEGE, while others were placed in schools like MINDAW, MAAHAD, and ST. PETERâ€™S to do their one month internship training.  After the completion of the one-month period, some of our students were fortunate enough to be offered full time employment with some of these organizations or schools.

Upon completion of their internship period, the students are required to write a report detailing all aspects of their experience and what they learned and contributed.  They will submit this report, and additionally give an oral presentation to SUNA staff, management and IT leaders based upon this report in order to earn their Diploma Certificate.  These presentations prove how far the students have progressed and why SUNA Institute of Science & Technology continues to be a leader in IT training education been offered in the Gambia!.
